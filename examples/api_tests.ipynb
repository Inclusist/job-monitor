It connects vetted suppliers across Asia, Europe, and the GCC region with local demand through a single integrated platform.\\nIts proprietary AI stack digitizes and automates the full lifecycle of materials trade — from procurement and pricing to inventory, logistics, and embedded financing — replacing thousands of manual, relationship-driven processes with real-time orchestration.\\nBuyers gain instant quotes, reliable availability, and predictable delivery through a unified operating system. Suppliers benefit from accurate forecasting, disciplined demand management, and seamless integration into cross-border fulfillment networks. The company partners with leading brands to run both dropship and cross-dock fulfillment motions for large-scale transactions, turning global supply chains into predictable, repeatable, software-like workflows.\\nBacked by top-tier investors and institutional financing partners, the company has scaled to triple-digit-million GMV, operates across six international markets, and is rapidly expanding toward profitability. With a team of 80+ people across Berlin (HQ) and Asia, it is building the world’s first industrial-grade AI operating system for materials — redefining how global trade works in one of the world’s largest and most essential industries.\\nAbout the Role\\nYou will lead and further develop the Data functions, specifically the engine that turns raw operational signals into real-time intelligence for Sales, Operations, Procurement, and Finance.\\nThis is not a back-office analytics role, it’s a front-line leadership role. You’ll own our data models, pipelines, and metrics - and develop AI-assisted systems that anticipate what happens next: which deal closes, which lane fails, which customer churns, which supplier delays, and how all our Agentic AI performs.\\nYou’ll partner closely with Growth, Operations, and Product to turn data into a competitive advantage - running the daily rhythm of dashboards, forecasts, and decisions that move millions in GMV each week.\\nAs part of our management leadership team, you will have a pathway to multi-region oversight, a highly competitive compensation package with performance-based incentives, and the opportunity to shape a high-performance organization from our Berlin headquarters, backed by top-tier investors.\\nFocus Areas\\nBuild the data backbone: Own our warehouse, models, and BI stack (SQL etc.) and ensure single-source-of-truth visibility for every team.\\nOperationalise insights: Work directly with Sales and Ops leadership to translate signal into action, quota pacing, margin tracking, reactivation triggers, fulfillment risks.\\nDevelop AI-assisted workflows: Collaborate with Tech to deploy GPT-based or agentic assistants for forecasting, pricing, and anomaly detection.\\nElevate reporting: Move the company from descriptive to predictive, automate recurring reports, and power daily management decisions.\\nOwn metrics: Define, implement, and track core KPIs across GMV, NRM, automation percentage and order quality.\\nCoach a small team of analysts: Hire, mentor, and scale an output-driven data team that combines speed with accuracy\\nBridge teams: Integrate Data into the heartbeat of the business, Sales, Ops, Finance, Procurement, and Product all run off your dashboards.\\nGuarantee data quality: Clean pipelines, consistent definitions, zero ambiguity.\\nWhat Success Looks Like\\n100% alignment on KPI definitions across departments\\nAutomated, self-updating dashboards for every business function.\\nForecast accuracy >95%, margin reporting live by GMV, margin, and region.\\nOne live AI-assisted data copilot embedded in Sales and Ops workflows within 3 months.\\nSignificant reduction in manual reporting - ≥50% of recurring tasks automated.\\nData stack clean, documented, and production-grade.\\nWeekly exec dashboards replacing static slide reports.\\nWe are an equal-opportunity employer and welcome applicants from all backgrounds, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, or any other characteristic.
